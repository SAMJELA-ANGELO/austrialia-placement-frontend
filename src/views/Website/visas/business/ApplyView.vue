      <p>
        The 482 Visa Program is primarily utilised by Australian Businesses or
        Overseas Businesses who intend to conduct business in Australia and
        require representatives, directors or employees to migrate to Australia.
        The Program structured through a business applying to become a Standard
        Business Sponsor (SBS).
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        You can use the 482 visa to setup your own company from overseas and
        migrate to Australia based on a branch in Australia, or establish a new
        business in Australia and migrate in order to develop that business.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The Department of Immigration can assess your business registration
        documents in your home country and issue immigration approval there.
        This means your directors or employees and their family members can
        obtain a temporary visa with minimal conditions.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Once in Australia you have the option to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>setup a branch</li>
        <li>purchase or operate an existing business</li>
        <li>establish a new business</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Once your Australian business is established, you can apply for
        permanent residence via the Subclass 186 visa.

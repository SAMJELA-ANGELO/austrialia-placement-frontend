      <p>Ministerial Intervention</p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        The Minister has the power under the Migration ACT 1958 to replace a
        decision of merits review of tribunal on applicant’s case with a more
        favorable decision. The case must meet the Minister’s guidelines. Some
        types of unique or exceptional circumstances are:
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Strong compassionate circumstances that if not recognised would result
        in serious, ongoing and irreversible harm and continuing hardship to an
        Australian citizen or an Australian family unit, where at least one
        member of the family is an Australian citizen or Australian permanent
        resident.
      </p>
      <p>
        Compassionate circumstances regarding your age and/or health and/or
        psychological state, that if not recognised would result in serious,
        ongoing and irreversible harm and continuing hardship.
      </p>
      <p>
        Exceptional economic, scientific, cultural or other benefit that would
        result from you being permitted to remain in Australia.
      </p>
      <p>
        Circumstances not anticipated by relevant legislation; or clearly
        unintended consequences of legislation; or the application of relevant
        legislation leads to unfair or unreasonable results in your case.

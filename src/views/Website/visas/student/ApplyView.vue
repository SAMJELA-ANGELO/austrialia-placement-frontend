      <h2>Graduate Temporary Subclass 485 Visa</h2>
      <p>
        This visa gives you full work rights in Australia for between 18 months
        and 2 years. You can use this time to accumulate points, which will help
        you find an employer sponsor and apply for skilled migration.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>This visa has two streams:</p>
      <p>
        <span>The Graduate Work stream</span> is designed for recent graduates
        with skills and qualifications in high demand occupations in the
        Australian labour market.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The Post-Study Work stream is for people who were granted their first
        Australian student visa on or after 5 November 2011. It applies to
        recent graduates with an Australian bachelor, masters or doctoral degree
        in any field of study.

      <h1>Employer Nomination Scheme (subclass 186)</h1>
      <p>
        There are three pathways under the
        <span>Employer Nomination Scheme (subclass 186)</span>
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <span>The Temporary Residence Transition </span>
        is an option for applicants who have:
      </p>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>
          worked with the employer on a 482 or TSS visa for the last 3 years
        </li>
        <li>an English level equivalent to IELTS 6</li>
      </ul>
      <h1>These applicants may need a skills assessment.</h1>
      <p>The Direct Entry Stream is an option for applicants who can:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>provide a formal skills assessment in their occupation</li>
        <li>show that they have worked in their occupation for three years</li>
        <li>have an English level equivalent to IELTS 6</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <span> The Agreement Stream </span>is an option where the employer has a
        labour agreement. Labour agreements are negotiated with the Department
        of Immigration to fill specific skills shortages. These can take up to
        nine months to obtain. The three types of labour agreements are
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Template Agreements for specific industries</li>
        <li>Regional Migration Agreements for a specific locality</li>
        <li>
          Enterprise Migration Agreements for large-scale resource projects

      <h1>
        Skilled Employer Sponsored Regional (Provisional) visa ( subclass 494)
      </h1>
      <p>
        SESR (494) visa is for skilled workers who want to work in regional
        Australia to fulfil skills shortages. A successful SESR applicant must
        work in the approved position for three years to be able to apply for
        Permanent Residence ( Regional) visa (subclass 191) . It is possible to
        qualify for this scheme with at least three years prior work experience
        and positive skill assessment.
      </p>
      <p>
        The conditions differ for regional Australia and employers sponsoring
        visa applicants in the regions can:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>qualify with lower skill levels</li>
        <li>sponsor an occupation listed in MLTSSL or ROL</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Aside from these variations, the process and pathways for SESR
        applications are similar to the SC 482 and SC 186 in regards to the
        Nomination and Visa Application, however the first and most critical
        step for SC 494 is applying to Standard Business Sponsorship and the
        Regional Development Authority, a successful RDA application means the
        region has approved the need for the position. Regional Development
        Authorities criteria can be complex.

      <h1>Designated Area Migration Agreement (DAMA)</h1>
      <p>
        A Designated Area Migration Agreement (DAMA) is a formal agreement
        between the Australian Government and a regional, state or territory
        authority. It provides access to more overseas workers than the standard
        skilled migration program. DAMAs operate under an agreement-based
        framework, providing flexibility for regions to respond to their unique
        economic and labour market conditions. <br />
        DAMA is employer sponsored program and individuals need to have a
        sponsor/employer to apply for 482 labor agreement visa. Currently there
        are seven DAMAs in place:

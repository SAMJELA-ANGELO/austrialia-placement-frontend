      <h1>Partner Visas</h1>
      <p>
        If you’re an Australian citizen or permanent resident we can help you
        bring your husband or wife, or de facto partner to Australia. The DIBP
        have implemented specific criteria to test your relationship over 2
        years, prior to granting permanent residency.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>There are two temporary partner visas</p>
      <br />
      <h2>Temporary Partner Visa (Subclass 309)</h2>
      <p>
        This is a visa for partners who are not living in Australia at the time
        of the application. An Australian visa office in your partner’s country
        of origin will process the application.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Temporary Partner Visa (Subclass 820)</h2>
      <p>
        This is a visa for people who have already entered Australia on a valid
        visa and wish to switch to a visa that reflects their partner status.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Both these visas can convert to permanent residency as subclass 100 or
        801 visas.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Prospective Marriage Visa (Subclass 300)</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        This temporary nine-month visa enables you to marry your prospective
        spouse in Australia or in another country. After your marriage you can
        apply for a partner visa leading to permanent residence.

      <h1>Parent Visas</h1>
      <p>
        If you are an Australian citizen or permanent resident you can apply to
        sponsor your parents to join you. Parent visa applications need to meet
        the following conditions.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>As a sponsor you must:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          be ’settled’ in Australia – this generally means having lived here
          legally for at least two years
        </li>
        <li>
          pass the ‘balance of family‘ test – this relates to the number of
          siblings you have and where they live
        </li>
        <li>
          pay the ‘contributory parent’ visa fees introduced in June 2014. These
          fees are designed to cover potentially high medical expenses for
          elderly people
        </li>
      </ul>

        Australian permanent resident or Citizen. Parents can apply for a
        further visa up to 10 years. The visa is multiple entry and there is no
        limit on the period of staying in Australia or overseas. Before applying
        for the visa, parents must have an approved sponsor.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
